### 1. IMPORT DATA ####
#######################

#import data
## Data: Default dataset in the ISLR has sample data on credit card customers
library(ISLR)
df <- Default

## view sample data
head(df, n=10) #top rows
tail(df) # last rows

#structure of the dataset
str(df)
# summary stats
summary(df)


######################
### 2. CLEAN DATA ###
#####################
###   - check for missing values , other data issues

### Dealing with missing data ###
# detect any missing data in dataframe
# - delete rows with missing data or insert NA cells with an estimate eg. an average #

#check for NAs/missing values
any(is.na(df))

# check for missing data anywhere in a column
# any(is.na(df$col)) 

# omit rows with missing values
# df<- na.omit(df)

## check for frequencies of categorical vairables
# there could be ways to improve the modeling dataset- 
## eg. if there are too many categories in a categorical variable or some of the categories have very low count, it might make sense to combine some categories
## eg. there could be very low number of rows for one of the response classes. 

#2 groups in student
table(df$student)

#too few observations of response default='Yes'. 
table(df$default)

colnames(df)

### set correct data types for columns
## factor() : set categorical columns as factors
# df$var <- factor(df$factor)
df$default <- factor(df$default)
df$student <- factor(df$student)



###########################################
### 3. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)  ###
###########################################

### check for assumptions of multiple regression
#  multicollinearity - high correlations among input variables : use correlation matrix of VIF
#  assumed linear relationship between response and predictors - scatter plot between response and a preditor var or after model building, do a scatter plot of residual error vs. predictor variables/fitted values
#  normality: distribution of numerical variables (eg. in a histogram) should roughly follow a bell curve. If the data is skewed, a transformatoin using log, square or square root might sort this issue

## get the structure of the data
str(df)
# summary stats
summary(df)  ##skewed towards class default YES (defaulter)

#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
## ggplot is based on the philosophy of grammar of graphics
## the idea is to add layers to visualisation
## layers 1-3 
## layer 1: data , layer 2: aesthetics (data columns to use in plotting), 
## layer 3 : geometries (type of plot)

# bar plot of default - default='Yes' has very few observations
# since default is a categorical variable, we are using a bar plot
ggplot(df,aes(default)) + geom_bar() +labs(x="default",y="Count",title="Distribution of default")

# bar plot of student-  
# since student is a categorical variables, we are using a bar plot
ggplot(df,aes(student)) + geom_bar() +labs(x="Student",y="Count",title="Distribution of student")
#students seem to be higher default rates - overall
ggplot(df,aes(student)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=default)) +labs(x="Student",y="Count",title="Distribution of student")


## box plot of student vs. balance 
ggplot(df,aes(x=student,y=balance)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=student))

# histograms - distribution of balance
# since balance is a CONTINIOUS numeric variable, we are using a histogram
ggplot(df,aes(balance)) + geom_histogram(fill='blue',alpha=0.5) +labs(x="Balance band",y="Count",title="Distribution of Amount")
# default rates seem to be higher at higher balance bands
ggplot(df,aes(balance)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill=default)) +labs(x="Balance band",y="Count",title="Distribution of Amount")

# histograms - distribution of income
# since income is a CONTINIOUS numeric variable, we are using a histogram
ggplot(df,aes(income)) + geom_histogram(fill='blue',alpha=0.5) +labs(x="Income band",y="Count",title="Distribution of Amount")

ggplot(df,aes(income)) + geom_histogram(aes(fill=default),alpha=0.5) +labs(x="Income band",y="Count",title="Distribution of Amount")




#### correlation analysis
# Grab only numeric columns
num.cols <- sapply(df, is.numeric)
# Filter to numeric columns for correlation
cor.data <- cor(df[,num.cols])
#cor.data <- cor(Smarket[,-9])

# print correlation matrix
# the correlations between the lag variables and todayâ€™s returns are close to zero
print(cor.data)  

## package to plot correlations
#install.packages('corrplot')
#install.packages('corrgram')
#library(corrgram)
library(corrplot)

# help(corrplot)
# plot correlations
corrplot(cor.data,method='color')
#corrgram(correlation.data,order=TRUE, lower.panel=panel.shade, upper.panel=panel.pie, text.panel=panel.txt)

# IF THERE IS MULTICOLLINEARITY, IT NEEDS OT BE DEALT WITH.

###   - Split data into Train and Test Groups
# install.packages("caTools")

# Import package

# use set.seed to reproduce results. expect to get the same sample again with the same seed number

###   - TRAIN model on train group

# logistic regression model in order to predict Direction using Lag1 through Lag5 
#and Volume.

# glm() function fits generalized linear models, a class of models that includes 
# logistic regression. The syntax of the glm() function is similar to that of lm(),
# except that we must pass in the argument 
# family=binomial in order to tell R to run a logistic regression rather than some other type of generalized linear model.

# how is dummy variable created for default
contrasts(df$default)  # Yes=1, No=0 ; model will be trained for probability of market going up

help(glm)
## Train the model for Direction /probability for direction = Up
glm.fits=glm(default ~ student + balance + income , data=train ,family=binomial)

#model summary
summary(glm.fits)
# The smallest p-value here is associated with Lag1. The negative coefficient for 
# this predictor suggests that if the market had a positive return yesterday, 
# then it is less likely to go up today. However, at a value of 0.15, the p-value 
# is still relatively large, and so there is no clear evidence of a real 
# association between Lag1 and Direction.

# model trained for probability of default=Yes
contrasts(train$default)  # Yes=1, No=0

# coef() function in order to access just the coefficients for this fitted model
coef(glm.fits)

## FEATURE SELECTION
# If there are lot of features or input variables, 
# it is desirable to use a subset of variables. 
# one way to choose the best subset is using stepwise regresiosn using 
#     the step() function.

help(step)

25/(25+13)  ## 66%
